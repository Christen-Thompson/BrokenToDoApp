# Fix this broken to do app

This to do app has been broken in several ways please fix it.

You can see the way the original app works here:

* Fork the App
* Run the app with your favorite local server (python, grunt, gulp etc ....)
* Make your changes
* Send a zip file of the app to the directed email address.


#List of bugs:

* app doesn't initialize
* unable to add to do items
* when editing a todo item if you press escape the original todo should be restored
* Clicking clear completed is removing all uncompleted todos and only leaving completed ones
* some others
